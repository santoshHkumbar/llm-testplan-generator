# Standard Test Plan Template

## 1. Test Plan Identifier
[Provide a unique identifier for this plan]

## 2. Introduction
[Summary of the software to be tested. Background, goals, and objectives.]

## 3. Test Items
[List the items (software, documents, hardware) to be tested.]

## 4. Features to be Tested
[List all functions and features to be tested from the user's perspective.]

## 5. Features Not to be Tested
[Identify features that will not be tested and why.]

## 6. Approach (Test Strategy)
[Description of how testing will be performed. Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance. Tools to be used.]

## 7. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
[Define the criteria used to determine whether each test item has passed or failed testing.]

## 8. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
[Criteria for stopping testing and what is needed to restart.]

## 9. Test Deliverables
[List the documents and artifacts to be produced (Test Plan, Test Cases, Reports).]

## 10. Testing Tasks
[List the tasks involved in the testing process.]

## 11. Environmental Needs
[Hardware, software, network, and other requirements.]

## 12. Responsibilities
[Who is responsible for what (Manager, Analyst, Tester, etc.)?]

## 13. Staffing and Training Needs
[Resource allocation and any training required.]

## 14. Schedule
[Milelines and deadlines for testing activities.]

## 15. Risks and Contingencies
[Potential risks and mitigation plans.]

## 16. Approvals
[Who needs to sign off on the plan.]


## 17. Entry Criteria
Testing starts once the application build, environment, test data, and required tools are ready and approved.

## 18. Exit Criteria
Testing ends when all planned test cases are executed, critical defects are closed, and test reports are approved.

## 19. Test Data Strategy
Test data will include valid, invalid, boundary, and negative scenarios covering all functional requirements.

## 20. Defect Management Process
All identified defects will be logged, tracked, retested, and closed using the defined defect life cycle.

## 21. Non-Functional Testing Considerations
Performance, security, usability, compatibility, scalability, and reliability will be validated as part of testing.

## 22. Assumptions and Dependencies
Testing assumes stable requirements and environments and depends on timely build delivery and system availability.
