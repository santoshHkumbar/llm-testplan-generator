# Example Improvements

## 1. Features to be Tested
**Improper:**
- We will test the app.
- Home screen.
- Settings.

**Proper:**
- **User Authentication:** Validate User Sign-up, Login, Password Recovery, and Session Management.
- **Dashboard Navigation:** Ensure all widgets load correctly and navigation links direct users to the appropriate modules.
- **Profile Management:** Test updating user profiles, picture uploads, and data persistence.

## 2. Risks and Contingencies
**Improper:**
- Site might go down.
- Not enough testers.

**Proper:**
- **Incomplete Documentation:** If requirements are not finalized by [Date], the testing schedule will be pushed back by an equivalent duration.
- **Environment Downtime:** If the QA environment is unavailable for more than 4 hours, testers will pivot to Test Case design or documentation review to maintain productivity.
- **Resource Constraints:** If a primary tester is unavailable, the Senior QA Lead will reallocate high-priority test cases to other team members.
